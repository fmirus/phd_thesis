\chapter{Experiments}

\begin{itemize}
	\item results on how different numerical encodings variants affect system performance
	\item result on how visual-semantic structures affects system performance
	\item impact of (quality and amount of) training data (problem of too little data)
	\item benchmarks: e.g. human level performance, other reference systems (linear prediction, established approaches)
\end{itemize}
